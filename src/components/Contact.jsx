                    In the boundless expanse of our universe, among the countless stars and infinite particles, our paths crossed â€“ a cosmic coincidence that I cherish every day. As this globe spins, mirroring the ceaseless dance of celestial bodies, I'm reminded of the astronomical odds that brought us together. In a universe filled with billions of galaxies, each teeming with trillions of stars, it's you who lights up my world. Our meeting was less likely than finding a single star in the night sky, yet here we are, a testament to the beautiful unpredictability of the cosmos.
